<h2>Wait—equations for swarms?</h2>
<p>Yes—algebraic equations, but with a twist: they come with <strong>visual notations built from (bi)graphical structures</strong>.  </p>
<p>This matters when working with systems like drone swarms or robot collectives—where agents move in space, interact locally, and must coordinate globally. Algebra here isn’t just numbers; it’s a <strong>language for structure</strong>. Combined with visual bigraphs, it becomes a powerful tool for describing collective behaviors.</p>
<h3>Algebraic Spaces</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigraph">Bigraphs</a> extend ordinary graphs with two complementary dimensions:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Locality</strong> – who is “inside” or “near” whom  </li>
<li><strong>Connectivity</strong> – who is linked or able to communicate  </li>
</ul>
<p>By combining these, bigraphs provide a <strong>unified algebraic and visual framework</strong> for systems where <em>geometry meets interaction</em>.  </p>
<p>We extend bigraphs into so-called <strong>bi-spatial structures</strong> — modular, grid-like building blocks that define discrete spatial layouts. <br />
These can model drones flying in formation, robots sorting themselves on a grid, or agents exploring an environment.  </p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>The following figures illustrate exemplary topological structures built from this “syntax of space” (which are formalized using our bigraphical axioms):</p>
<p><img alt="Bigraphical Landscape of the Axioms" src="static/images/bigraph-algebra-2.png" /></p>
<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concrete + formal</strong>: Models are both visually intuitive <em>and</em> mathematically precise.  </li>
<li><strong>Composable</strong>: Complex swarms are built from simple axioms (“bi-spatial axioms”), ensuring modularity.  </li>
<li><strong>Dynamic</strong>: Agents evolve via reaction rules, giving rise to algebraic swarm equations that capture both motion and coordination.  </li>
<li><strong>Debuggable</strong>: Equations can be analyzed by calculators and through extensions like 3D raycasting, swarm evolution can be <em>observed</em> in real time. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Foundations of UniAgent: Bigraphical Models</h3>
<p>The UniAgent platform builds on a small set of <strong>bi-spatial axioms</strong>—algebraic rules that define how discrete locales connect. These axioms form the backbone for modeling swarms as <strong>algebraic spaces</strong>, where agents move, interact, and adapt.  </p>
<p>Think of them as the Lego-bricks of swarm modeling: simple, composable, and grounded in both algebra and geometry.  </p>

<small>This figures presents an overview of the bi-spatial axioms.</small></p>

<hr />
<p>The following pages explore drone equations through the lens of <strong>bigraphical reactive systems (BRS)</strong>—a form of <strong>graphical, rule-based system</strong>. These systems are <strong>evolutionary</strong> and <strong>causally closed</strong>, providing a modular framework for modeling dynamic interactions.</p>
<p>BRSs allow representing and reasoning about dynamic, spatially organized systems. 
Discrete states are expressed as algebraic equations.
The equations are expressed in terms of <strong>bigraphs</strong>.
A BRS easily captures the relational and reactive nature of agent interactions in a structured and visually intuitive way.</p>
<p>What is also explored is how <strong>composition</strong> can be used to manage high-level, macroscopic, and emergent behaviors within drone swarms.</p>
<p>To ensure correctness, the equations are formally verified using formal methods (i.e., <strong>directed model checking</strong> techniques), where swarm programs are primarily formulated as reachability problems.</p>
<p>For reproducibility, we provide the initial conditions, rule sets, and correctness properties to help you replicate the results and re-verify the system's behavior.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the proof method constitutes not merely a formal verification technique, but also the primary approach for actual execution.</p></div>

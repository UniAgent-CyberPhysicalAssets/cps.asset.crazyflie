<p>Wait—<strong>equations</strong> for drones?</p>
<p>Yes—algebraic equations, but with a twist: they come with <strong>visual notations</strong> built from <strong>(bi)graphical structures</strong>.</p>
<p>This might sound abstract, but it makes a lot of sense when working with systems like drones—where agents operate in <strong>space</strong>, and their <strong>behaviors</strong> are deeply tied to both <strong>geometry</strong> and <strong>topology</strong>. 
Algebra isn't just about numbers; it's also a language for structure, and when applied visually, it becomes a useful tool for modeling collective drone behaviors.</p>
<h3>Algebraic Spaces</h3>
<p>By using algebraic models that are inherently visual—such as <strong>bigraphs</strong>—we can describe both <strong>how drones behave</strong> and <strong>how they relate spatially</strong> to one another and to their environment.</p>
<p>Simply speaking, bigraphs are a type of <strong>graph</strong> that can represent both <strong>spatial</strong> and <strong>temporal</strong> relationships.</p>
<p>The foundation of UniAgent relies on several so-called <strong>bigrid axioms</strong>.
These are illustrated below and serve as fundamental algebraic building blocks for defining the connectedness between dimensionless local, discrete spaces.</p>

<small>This figures presents an overview of the bigrid axioms.</small></p>
<p>Read more about it here: <a href="https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bsz:14-qucosa2-908655">A Bigraphical Framework for Modeling and Simulation of UAV-based Inspection Scenarios</a></p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>The following figures illustrate exemplary topological structures built from this “syntax of space” (which are formalized using our bigraphical axioms):</p>
<p><img alt="Bigraphical Landscape of the Axioms" src="static/images/bigraph-algebra-2.png" /></p>
<h3>Bigraphical Models</h3>
<p>The following pages explore drone equations through the lens of <strong>bigraphical reactive systems (BRS)</strong>—a form of <strong>graphical, rule-based system</strong>. These systems are <strong>evolutionary</strong> and <strong>causally closed</strong>, providing a modular framework for modeling dynamic interactions.</p>
<p>BRSs allow representing and reasoning about dynamic, spatially organized systems. 
Discrete states are expressed as algebraic equations.
The equations are expressed in terms of <strong>bigraphs</strong>.
A BRS easily captures the relational and reactive nature of agent interactions in a structured and visually intuitive way.</p>
<p>What is also explored is how <strong>composition</strong> can be used to manage high-level, macroscopic, and emergent behaviors within drone swarms.</p>
<p>To ensure correctness, the equations are formally verified using formal methods (i.e., <strong>directed model checking</strong> techniques), where swarm programs are primarily formulated as reachability problems.</p>
<p>For reproducibility, we provide the initial conditions, rule sets, and correctness properties to help you replicate the results and re-verify the system's behavior.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the proof method constitutes not merely a formal verification technique, but also the primary approach for actual execution.</p></div>
